# Wordaurus
Wordaurus is an iOS game app I created where the user has to guess any synonym to the word that appears on the screen. The synonyms were generated with the word as a parameter and generating possible symptoms using the [English Synonyms API](https://rapidapi.com/ericmorvax-2YHUl-ynmUD/api/english-synonyms) by Eric Marvin. I used NSUserDefaults to keep track of the player’s score and to display the player’s high score. I used the [ConfettiView](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ConfettiView) CocoaPod by Or Ron to add confetti when the score page appears. This app was fun to create and to play.

Wordaurus was built with Xcode and written in Swift 5X. The design was created using Storyboard and Auto Layout.
